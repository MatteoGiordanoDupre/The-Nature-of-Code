// Write the limit() function for the p5.Vector class

//easy easy exercise. It's about creating an if statement that checks if the magnitude of the given vector goes beyond the argument.
//If it does, we normalize the vector and multiply it by the argument, so that its value stays capped.
//Solution i thought of is exactly the same solution as the site's one, but i wonder if there are other ones. This looks like the most efficient. 



  limit(max) {
    if (this.mag() > max) {
      this.normalize();
      this.mult(max);
    }
  }
